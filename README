NAME
    HTML::TagCloud - Generate An HTML Tag Cloud

SYNOPSIS
      my $cloud = HTML::TagCloud->new;
      $cloud->add($tag1, $url1, $count1);
      $cloud->add($tag2, $url2, $count2);
      $cloud->add($tag3, $url3, $count3);
      my $html = $cloud->html_and_css(50);

DESCRIPTION
    The HTML::TagCloud module enables you to generate "tag clouds" in HTML.
    Tag clouds serve as a textual way to visualize terms and topics that are
    used most frequently. The tags are sorted alphabetically and a larger
    font is used to indicate more frequent term usage.

    Example sites with tag clouds: <http://www.43things.com/>,
    <http://www.astray.com/recipes/> and
    <http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/>.

    This module provides a simple interface to generating a CSS-based HTML
    tag cloud. You simply pass in a set of tags, their URL and their count.
    This module outputs stylesheet-based HTML. You may use the included CSS
    or use your own.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
    The constructor takes one optional argument:

      my $cloud = HTML::TagCloud->new(levels=>10);

    if not provided, leves defaults to 24

METHODS
  add
    This module adds a tag into the cloud. You pass in the tag name, its URL
    and its count:

      $cloud->add($tag1, $url1, $count1);
      $cloud->add($tag2, $url2, $count2);
      $cloud->add($tag3, $url3, $count3);

  tags($limit)
    Returns a list of hashrefs representing each tag in the cloud, sorted by
    alphabet. each tag has the following keys; name, count, url and level.

  css
    This returns the CSS that will format the HTML returned by the html()
    method with tags which have a high count as larger:

      my $css  = $cloud->css;

  html($limit)
    This returns the tag cloud as HTML without the embedded CSS (you should
    use both css() and html() or simply the html_and_css() method). If a
    limit is provided, only the top $limit tags are in the cloud, otherwise
    all the tags are in the cloud:

      my $html = $cloud->html(200);

  html_and_css($limit)
    This returns the tag cloud as HTML with embedded CSS. If a limit is
    provided, only the top $limit tags are in the cloud, otherwise all the
    tags are in the cloud:

      my $html_and_css = $cloud->html_and_css(50);
